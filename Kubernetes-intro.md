# *Kubernetes-Production-Setups*

In the Kubernetes, there are multiple types of **Kubernetes setups** available depending on the **deployment model**, **infrastructure**, and **ease of management**. These setups can be broadly categorized into **production-ready**, **development/testing**, and **under development** or **emerging technologies**
## 1.  Managed Kubernetes Services (Production-Grade)
Fully managed by cloud providers.

-  **Amazon EKS** (Elastic Kubernetes Service)
-  **Azure AKS** (Azure Kubernetes Service)
-  **Google GKE** (Google Kubernetes Engine)
-  **IBM Cloud** Kubernetes Service
-  **Oracle OKE** (Oracle Kubernetes Engine)
-  **DigitalOcean Kubernetes**
-  **Linode Kubernetes Engine**

➡️  Pros: Easy to set up, managed control plane, scalable, secure.
➡️  Use case: Enterprise production workloads.

## 2.  Self-Managed Kubernetes (Production/Custom Use Cases)
You manage the control plane and worker nodes.

a.  Using **kubeadm**
-  Manually provisioned clusters (e.g., on-premises or cloud VMs)
-  Common for learning, POCs, and flexible production setups.

b.  Using **Kops (Kubernetes Operations)**
-  Set up Kubernetes on AWS, GCP, OpenStack.
-  Infrastructure as code + automation-friendly.

c. **Kuberspray** (Ansible-based)
-  Highly customizable.
-  Supports multiple cloud/on-premise providers.

➡️ Pros: Full control, customizable.
➡️ Use case: Custom environments, hybrid cloud, air-gapped setups.

## 3.  Lightweight Kubernetes Distributions
Ideal for edge, IoT, development, or low-resource environments.

-  **k3s** – Lightweight Kubernetes by Rancher (IoT/Edge)
-  **MicroK8s** – Minimal install by Canonical (Ubuntu)
-  **Minikube** – Runs Kubernetes locally (ideal for developers)
-  **Kind (Kubernetes in Docker)** – Run Kubernetes clusters in Docker containers
-  **RKE (Rancher Kubernetes Engine)** – Used with Rancher for multi-cluster management
-  **RKE2** – Next-gen, hardened RKE for production (CIS benchmark-compliant)

➡️ Pros: Fast setup, low overhead, easy to test.
➡️ Use case: Development, CI/CD pipelines, Edge computing.

## 4.  Kubernetes Platforms with Abstraction and Add-ons
Packaged with UI, monitoring, policy, security, multi-cluster management.

-  **OpenShift (by Red Hat)** – Enterprise-ready with built-in CI/CD, RBAC, image registry, etc.
-  **VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid** – Integrates with vSphere
-  **Rancher** – Centralized management of multiple Kubernetes clusters
-  **Platform9** – SaaS-managed Kubernetes for on-prem/cloud

➡️ Pros: Full-featured platforms.
➡️ Use case: Enterprises needing visibility, control, and support.

## 5.  Experimental & Under Development / Emerging Approaches

-  **KubeEdge** – Kubernetes-native edge computing framework.
-  **OpenYurt** – Extends Kubernetes to edge without requiring cloud access.
-  **Liqo** – Dynamic multi-cluster and multi-cloud federation.
-  **Virtual Kubelet** – For serverless and virtual node integration.
-  **Karmada** – Kubernetes multi-cluster orchestration.
-  **KubeVirt** – Run VMs on Kubernetes (virtualization on Kubernetes).
-  **Gardener (by SAP)** – Meta-Kubernetes: manages other Kubernetes clusters.
-  **Cluster API (CAPI)** – Declarative Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management.
-  **Talos Linux** – OS built for Kubernetes, minimal and immutable.

➡️ Pros: Focus on advanced use cases – edge, multi-cluster, hybrid.
➡️ Use case: Experimental, large-scale, federated Kubernetes


# We already seen **Kubeadm**, Why **KOPS** ? Let me clarity it with simple tabular format [**Kubeadm vs KOPS**]
